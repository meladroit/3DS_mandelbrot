Mandelbrot for 3DS

outputs:
    top is 3D render of Mandelbrot
        stereo separation = final iteration on that pixel
        x\in(-2.375,1.375)
        y\in(-1.125,1.125)
    bottom is 2D render of Mandelbrot
        x\in(-2,1)
        y\in(-1.125,1.125)

inputs:
    START breaks, obviously
    touchscreen tap should zoom view around point
    B should reset to original view

questions:
    do we want to hardcode screen dimensions into this?
        yes
            400x240 top
            320x240 lower
    how do we handle lower screen render?
        we don't want to run two Mandelbrot iterations at once
        crop top dataset
            deltaHeight = max(0,(fbHeight-fbHeight_lower)/2)
            deltaWidth = max(0,(fbWidth-fbWidth_lower)/2)
            paint thing at x+deltaWidth,y+deltaHeight on top to x,y on lower
        

constants:
    #define XLOWER = -2.375
    #define XUPPER = 1.375
    #define YLOWER = -1.125
    #define YUPPER = 1.125
    #define MAX_ITER = 42
variables:
    #define CONFIG_3D_SLIDERSTATE (*(float*)0x1FF81080) //thanks shinyquagsire23
    float[fbWidth] x0;
    float[fbHeight] y0;
    float[fbWidth*fbHeight] x,y,iteration;
    int iteration = 0;
